# EndlessMod
EndlessMod is the Minecraft: Java Edition Fabric modpack which aims to retain vanilla atmosphere with endless possibility.

# Editions
We have two available editions to choose, **Infinity** and **Universal**.

Looking for 1.16 and 1.17 version of EndlessMod Libre? Click on Discontinued Editions to see the version.

* [**Infinity**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/infinity/1.18/infinity.md) is the modpack focused on adding more content aimed for unlimited possibilites, while keeping the vanilla gameplay. Expanding the technology or magic... Everything is up to you!
    * [**Infinity LTS**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/infinity/1.18/infinity.md) is the long-term support variant of Infinity. This mod is for people who wish to stay in the current version without having changes on every update, instead of having frequent content changes.
* [**Universal**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/universal/1.18/universal.md)(Previously known as Satallite) is the Fabric based modpack. It aims to keep the vanilla gameplay while improving and optimizing the game, and to support both Singleplayer and Multiplayer without affecting content changes to the world.

* [**Edge**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/edge/edge.md) is the Forge based modpack. It is based on LTS version of Minecraft Forge, to comply with their [support policy](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/topic/91712-supported-version-directory/). It has many mods compared with Libre edition. Edge version will no longer be supported after 1.18 release.
* [**Libre**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/libre/1.17/libre.md) is the Fabric based modpack. It always uses latest version of Fabric and Minecraft version compared with Forge edition. It has less mods compared with Edge edition. Currently [1.16.5 version (Extended support)](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/libre/1.16/libre.md) and [1.17.1 version](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/libre/1.17/libre.md) is supported.
