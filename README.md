# Warning! Security Flaw
On December 10 2021, PaperMC team recently found exploit related to log4j, the Java-based logging utility, and this is severe issue.

**If you are reading this and playing Minecraft with old launcher version, we advise you to close ANY minecraft instance and restart the launcher to apply the fix.**

**Additionally if you are using our modpack, please upgrade your Fabric Loader to 0.12.9 or higher.**

As of this announcement, we are ending support for any version below 1.18 from now on. Please use 1.18 version to prevent any further security issues.

# EndlessMod
EndlessMod is the Minecraft: Java Edition Fabric modpack which aims to retain vanilla atmosphere with endless possibility.

# Editions
We have two available editions to choose, **Infinity** and **Universal**.

* [**Infinity**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/infinity/1.18/infinity.md) is the modpack focused on adding more content aimed for unlimited possibilites, while keeping the vanilla gameplay. Expanding the technology or magic... Everything is up to you!
    * [**Infinity LTS**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/infinity/1.18/infinity.md) is the long-term support variant of Infinity. This mod is for people who wish to stay in the current version without having changes on every update, instead of having frequent content changes.
* [**Universal**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/universal/1.18/universal.md)(Previously known as Satallite) is the Fabric based modpack. It aims to keep the vanilla gameplay while improving and optimizing the game, and to support both Singleplayer and Multiplayer without affecting content changes to the world.
