# Announcement: This project is no longer maintained
Hello everyone,

We are sad to announce that this project is no longer in development, due to lack of time to maintain, loss of interest in Minecraft, and lack of content mods on Fabric mod loader.

Thank you for using using this project.

# EndlessMod
EndlessMod is the Minecraft: Java Edition Fabric modpack which aims to retain vanilla atmosphere with endless possibility.

# Editions
We have two available editions to choose, **Infinity** and **Universal**.

* [**Infinity**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/infinity/1.18/infinity.md) is the modpack focused on adding more content aimed for unlimited possibilites, while keeping the vanilla gameplay. Expanding the technology or magic... Everything is up to you!
    * [**Infinity LTS**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/infinity/1.18/infinity.md) is the long-term support variant of Infinity. This mod is for people who wish to stay in the current version without having changes on every update, instead of having frequent content changes.
* [**Universal**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/universal/1.18/universal.md)(Previously known as Satallite) is the Fabric based modpack. It aims to keep the vanilla gameplay while improving and optimizing the game, and to support both Singleplayer and Multiplayer without affecting content changes to the world.
