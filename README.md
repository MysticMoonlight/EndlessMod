# EndlessMod
EndlessMod is the Minecraft: Java Edition modpack which aims to retain vanilla atmosphere with endless possiblity.

# Editions
We have two available editions to choose, **Edge** and **Libre**.

- [**Edge**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/edge.md) is the Forge based modpack. It is based on LTS version of Minecraft Forge, to comply with their [support policy](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/topic/91712-supported-version-directory/). It has many mods compared with Libre edition.
- [**Libre**](https://github.com/MysticMoonlight/EndlessMod/blob/main/editions/libre.md) is the Fabric based modpack. It always uses latest version of Fabric and Minecraft version compared with Forge edition. It has less mods compared with Edge edition.
