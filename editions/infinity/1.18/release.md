# Release Notes - EndlessMod Infinity 18 "The Phantom of the Dark"

## Stable
### endlessmod-infinity-18 (Dec 12, 2021)
Welcome to new release of EndlessMod Infinity! This release features Tech Reborn 1.18, some new Quality-of-Life improvements and fixes of 1.18.

This was originally planned to release on December 15, 2021. However there was major security flaw present on Minecraft: Java Edition, so we had to pull the release date to Dec 12, 2021 with the sacrifice of compatibility of old version.

As we announced, if you are using EndlessMod Libre, please upgrade the version to this version immediately to prevent further security issues.

EndlessMod 18 supports Minecraft: Java Edition 1.18/1.18.1, and Fabric Loader 0.12.9 and higher version.

We hope you enjoy this release! We apologize for rushing the release, so there will have lack of contents present on 1.18 release. We will be adding some features from minor releases, if possible!

Also please refrain from using unsupported mods listed below! They might cause incompatibility errors or may crash the game.

**Warning: Upgrading your existing worlds from 1.17 or below are not supported due to major changes to mod list.**

#### Changelog
* Removed all YUNG's mod since they are not actively maintained
* Replaced Fabrilous updater with Modget, best alternative of updating the mod (Currently it only checks for new version so you need to install updates manually)
* Moved all 1.18-ready mods to mod list
