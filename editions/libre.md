### How to keep mod up to date ###
As of 1.17.1-libre-labs2 update, auto updater named Fabrilous Updater has been added. This will allow you to keep the mod up to date, which usually includes bug fixes and new features.

Use following command to manage updates. Please note that Fabrilous Updater does not check for update automatically!
/fabdate update - Shows a list of mods needing updates with a clickable download link.
/fabdate autoupdate - Automatically removes old mods and downloads new mods.

### Warning ###
- Do not download mods on illegal mod redistribute website such as 9minecraft, instead we recommended you downloading from their official release website such as CurseForge, Modrinth. Clicking on hyperlink above will lead you to official download site.
- EndlessMod Edge and EndlessMod Libre modpacks are unsupported each other, so do not try to install both modpacks in a same directory! It will cause a serious conflict issue. (We recommend making another directory when installing the modpack, you've been warned!)
