# EndlessMod Libre #
### What is it? ###
EndlessMod is a Minecraft: Java Edition modpack which aims to keep the vanilla atmosphere experience with endless possibilities.
This modpack is Libre Edition, which always have latest version of Fabric.

**WARNING:** This is Labs version, which is supposed to be testing release. You should expect any bug since most mods are in beta, which makes modpack unstable.

The 1.17 stable release is expected to be released on September 2021.

Due to copyright concerns, like Half-Life 2 Modpack, the mod will be listed instead. You need to install the mods and put it on mods folder manually.
